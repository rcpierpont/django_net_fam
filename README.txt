This project was started as a way for me to learn python. Maybe, if I stick with it, to create something useful that other people can use.

As of 4-21-2024 my idea for this project is a 'social media' webapp with a lot of the modern-day craziness of social media removed. 

Over the years I have become more distant with extended family that I care for very much, and it's become increasingly difficult to keep up
with who uses what social media. Even then, a lot of that is filled with ads, people I don't remember, or frankly, people or content I don't care about.

The solution I thought of was to make something of my own and invite the people I care about to use that. Maybe it'll catch on, maybe it won't, but worst-case scenario is I learn something from it so why not?

Core features to implement (working list):
- user registration, login and authentication over public internet (hosting solution TBD)
- group-based user permissions that determine what content (and from whom) is displayed
- delegated group membership management (aka, ability for admin to give other people ability to manage groups)
- ability for users to post blog-style posts which may or may not include attached images or links to other content
