This project was started as a way for me to learn python. 

As of 4-21-2024 my idea for this project is a 'social media' webapp without a lot of the modern-day pain points social media. 

Over the years I have become more distant with extended family that I care for very much, and it's become increasingly difficult to keep up
with who uses what apps. Even then, a lot of that is filled with ads or content I don't care about. With this app, people will be able to trust that what they see is coming from people they know.

Core features to implement (working list):
- user registration, login and authentication over public internet (hosting solution TBD)
- group-based user permissions that determine what content (and from whom) is displayed
- delegated group membership management (aka, ability for admin to give other people ability to manage groups)
- ability for users to post blog-style posts which may or may not include attached images or links to other content
